Hello world I'm ***Ritobrato***, presently a grad student at [IISER Thiruvananthapuram][iisertvm] and an [integrated PhD][iphd] student in the school of biology, presently exploring the different domains of science. I also love coding and in general just chilling out with like minded people. Ooo and if you landed here for professional reasons, here is my [LinkedIn][ld] profile.

I graduated from [Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira][rkmv] with a major in **Zoology** and was fortunate to learn from a scientist who rekindled my passion for science. He took me in and guided me for alomst 3 months and I learnt a ton of stuff from him. Enough on academics!! I'm a fan of **Formula one** and **Daniel Riccardo**, love his attitude. Yes, I'm a fan of **Marvel Comics** and Iron Man and shed tears in The Avengers Endgame. I also love mountains and recently joined a trekking team en-route to the Talung Glacier north of Goecha La, but that's a story for another day. I enjoy swimming, badminton, movies and occasionally play video games when bored ðŸ˜…

It feels great to have my first ***blogging website*** up and ready! I will be writing about my daily life at IISER and whatever else comes to my mind. I also hang out in [Quora][quora], look me up there. So, if you love it here, come back again. O and spread the word yah!
