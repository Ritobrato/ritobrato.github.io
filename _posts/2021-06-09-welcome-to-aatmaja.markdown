Welcome to my first blogging website ***Aatmaja***. This is my creation and somewhat like a child, hence the name. I figured out how to build static websites using [Jekyll][jekyll], based on **Ruby** to effortlessly write and format my posts. I have worked with other languages before but Jekyll is faster and allows me to focus more on the content.

The primary motivation for setting up this blog was to allow people, esp students to learn more about life in [IISER TVM][iiser], one of the most beautiful campus in the country! I wanted to start blogging as soon as I stepped in **iiser** but the pandemic struck and really made our lives miserable. Nevertheless, I will start writing soon but before that let me briefly explain all the features of the website

### Features of ~Aatmaja website

It is quite simple with a dark background. The successive posts will appear on the home page once published. The latest posts will be at the top, followed by the older ones. I will soon add a comment section.

There is another page, ***About*** where you can find more about me. If you are viewing this on a mobile, you may not see it, but click on the top right corner and it will appear under a dropdown list.

I will also add a posts list once I've populated the home page with lots of content. _Stay tuned!_
