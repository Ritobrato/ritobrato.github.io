In the first blog post, I expressed my love for the mountains. I had an opportunity to join a team that set off to explore the unknown mountainous terrains of Yangiotak. In this series of posts I will try to pen down my experiences about the trail, the perils and the beauty of an adventure in the mountains of West-Sikkim. *Stay tuned!*

>Ten indomitable members of the **Berhampur Adventure Club (BAC)** in the district of Murshidabad, West Bengal venture out to an unknown and sacred place of Sikkim named **Yangiotak** adjacent to the **Talung glacier**. This region of Sikkim is restricted for trekkers. Permission from Tourism & Civil Aviation Department along with Divisional Forest Officer, KNP is required for entering in this region. Through this trail, one can travel to North-Sikkim by either crossing **Zemu Gap** or through **Sakyong**.

### Off to Dzongri valley

It was on October 24th, 2018 we set out to explore the lesser known trail after **Goecha la**, to **Yangiotak**. *Yuksum*, the early capital of Sikkim is the trail-head. It is akin to a gateway for trekkers going towards **the Kanchanjunga**. The trail from *Yuksum* to *Bakhim* was extremely laborious, enough to dampen the spirit of any amateur trekker! We crossed four gushing mountain streams in a misty weather to reach ***Bakhim (8200 mt approx)***. A densely forested stretch, interspersed with boisterous streams and hanging bridges lead us to the **Kanchanjunga National park**. The trail introduced us to the lovely flora of the jungle, the view of the confluence or Sangam of Prek-Chu and Rathong-Chu rivers is one of the highlights of this jungle trail. The first campsite before *Bakhim* was *Sachen*, it was deep inside the national park. There was a small stream nearby and a wonderful view of thick forests ahead, it makes *Sachen* a beautiful camp site for amateur trekkers enroute to *Bakhim*.

The next day we set out for *Phedang*. Since we gained altitude rapidly, we had to shorten the distance of our trek to acclimatize us. On our way to Phedang, we crossed a lovely campsite in *Tshoka* facing the imposing snow-capped peaks of *Pandim* and *Japnu*. Tsokha means Holy Water in the local language. A monastery situated alongside a small lake, is a nice place to visit at this campsite. After a short tea break at Tshoka we set off once more, and reached Phedang after a few hours of grueling ascent through a dense forest. Phedang taught me the pitfalls of rapid altitude gain, I had a piercing headache and spent a sleepless night. It was the eve of ***Lakshmi puja*** in bengal the moon shown bright at night, and I spent the remaining hours gazing at the beautiful full moon that bathed the campsite with a silver glow.

The next day, after a steep climb from Phedang we reached *Deorali Top*; a place notorious for furious and bitingly cold winds. At the top we were greeted by the charming sight of a 270 degree panorama of snow-clad peaks! It drizzled while we made our way to **Dzongri valley (13200 ft)**. We pitched the tents and after a short tea break went off for height gaining exercise. We climbed up the windy and highest top of Dzongri valley, and the vast stretches of wilderness became visible surrounded by snow-clad peaks. *Chortens*, (prayer flags) and *mani walls* (inscription on religious stones) abound, Dzongri is where the wise old lamas stay for many weeks to pray and meditate, whilst on a pilgrimage. From the holy meadows, the entire Singalila ridge is visible round to the *Chumbab la* and the *Kang la*. In the evening it snowed, at first it appeared like powder puff but it intensified in a short while, and soon our multi-colored tents turned white!
