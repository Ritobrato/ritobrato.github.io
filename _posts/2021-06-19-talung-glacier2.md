### A Perilous trail

The following morning, we set off for **Thansing**, awesome weather allowed full view of the mountains around. On the way a long descent led us to a river Prek chu, to a place called Khokchurang. After a short break at Khokchurang we crossed the river, negotiated a boulder zone and entered a thick forest. The last leg of the trek for the day was a long and gradual ascent on a beautiful trail along the river to Thansing. The temperatures dropped significantly at Thansing and we layered up as we watched the valley, and sipped hot tea!

On 28th Oct we crossed several icy streams, the clear skies heralded full view of *Pandim* and *Tin-chen-khang* till *Zemathang*, our next campsite. After a smooth trail through Lamuney there was a laborious ascent from Samiti Lake. We spotted 9 Ibex on the opposite bank of the tributary that feeds the Lake. After the ascent we reached a view point from where, Onglakthang glacier, Kabru Dome, Forked peak were in full view to our left. We traversed a vast expanse of a dried up river akin to a sandy desert, Chemathang (Chema - sand, thang - a plain). This is the flat, sandy floor of an old lake at 15,250 ft beneath the great west wall of Pandim. From the first view point there exists no trail and we relied heavily on our expert sherpa cook Marie to find a campsite. Marie went ahead on a recce and we soon lost him in the vast wilderness of the valley. The place was abound with multiple footprints and excreta of leopards and other wildlife; as daylight faded we grew more tense with every passing minute. We were hopelessly lost but fortunately our LO Lakpa spotted the only stream and we approached it to find Marie prowling around!

By nightfall we had set up camp in Zemathang and held a meeting to discuss plans for the final leg of the trek. The cold and difficult terrain had taken its toll, and few of our team members were suffering from altitude sickness. The day's ordeal was intimidating and I was silent, unsure whether I would be able to complete the trek. After the brief meeting our team leader sorted out the fittest 2 among us who would continue. Zemathang as we found out houses leopards and other wild animals, so we observed certain safety practices at night.

*To be continued...*
