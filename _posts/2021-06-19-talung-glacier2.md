It snowed heavily that night, I closed my eyes and could hear the faint clanging of bells as yaks grazed on the valley, a rustic musical tribute to the Himalayas. The wind howled outside, and the kitchen tent started flapping. The more experienced teammates assured me that all would be well by next morning. I tried to stay awake but soon fell into a slumber, that night I dreamt us making our way through a dense jungle, tall trees with their mossy branches blocked all sunlight, the eerie silence of the jungle was overpowered with crickets’ buzzing and birds chirping merrily. The narrow trail through the jungle never seemed to end, and I walked on in a trance determined to uncover the alluring secrets it possessed.

## Dzongri to Thansing

The following morning, we set off for **Thansing**, awesome weather allowed full view of the mountains around. On the way a long descent led us to the river Prek chu, the place is known as *Khokchurang*. The route from Dzongri to Khokchurang, descends steeply into a gorge. As the elevation lowered, the weather became warmer. While Dzongri had no vegetation other than rhododendron shrubs, khokchurang was surrounded by dense pine forests.

The team took a break, I was too tired to move, and so laid down my rucksack and opened my shoes and socks. Legs stretched out, I sat on the grassy river bed of Khokchurang under the sun. A small trekker's hut on my right, a river gushing by my left and dense forest on the opposite bank makes up the cosy little paradise. After a tiring trek from Dzongri, the short break made me feel sleepy, the soft grass, the warmth of the sun, felt divine. We left Khokchurang after the stopover, crossed the river, negotiated a boulder zone and entered the thick forest. As we made our way further in, silence ensued, the crashing of the river ebbed away; the pine trees with their mossy overgrown branches blocked out the sunlight. It felt as if I was a traveller on an alien planet, who chose the path least treaded. Where the inhabitants were shy; neither they showed up nor made their presence evident, but watched us intently from behind the undergrowth. The last leg of the trek for that day was a long and gradual ascent through the pine forest along the river to Thansing. As we climbed higher once again, a chilly wind rushed in rattling the tree branches. Lack of sunlight immediately made the place colder, and our hands were numb often. As we approached Thansing, the vegetation gradually receded and the temperature dipped again, idle hands soon became numb making it increasingly difficult to negotiate the treacherous terrain.

*Onwards to Thansing, before entering the pine forest.*

We reached Thansing by four in the afternoon; as we started looking for a suitable campsite the weather went south, and it soon became very windy. There was a yak hut nearby and a few other teams camping, the bad weather caught them off-guard and they scuttled inside the tents. Temperature nosedived by the time we picked a suitable spot near the stream, the wind chill made it worse. We had to set up three tents for ourselves besides a kitchen tent, and we raced to pitch all, as the biting cold made a senior member sick. My fingers were numb due to the cold and I struggled to work with the hammer and pitons, somehow, we managed to get the job done.

*A snap of the Thansing valley, the following morning.*

We layered up as we watched the sun setting over the valley, and sipped hot tea. Thansing is a massive, undulated valley at an altitude of *12,900 ft,* and stretches for miles up to *Lamuney*, surrounded by a rocky ridge on one side and several snow-clad peaks on the other. It has no vegetation other than juniper, rhododendron and thorny shrubs. The valley houses a stream that originates from the *Onglakthang glacier*, and flows downstream past Khokchurang. The sunset was unlike anything I ever witnessed, the snowy peaks were painted with a yellow hue, in stark contrast to the clear blue skies. Dinner was cooked and we retired early after an eventful albeit tiring day.
