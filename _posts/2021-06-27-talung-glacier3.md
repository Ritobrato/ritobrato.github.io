On 28th of October we crossed several icy streams, the clear skies heralded full view of the *Pandim* and *Tin-chen-khang* peaks, that towered over us till **Zemathang**, our next campsite. The trail led us through Lamuney to the *Samiti lake*, the greenish blue hue of the water awed us! Indeed it is amazing how beautifully nature can shape the most mundane, if left undisturbed. While we admired the lake, we spotted about nine Ibex scampering about the massive rocks on the opposite bank of the tributary feeding the Lake. After a stopover we trudged on, a laborious ascent from the lake led us to the **first view point**. *Onglakthang glacier*, *Kabru Dome*, *Forked peak* were in full view to our left.

> The Sikkim govt. does not allow amateur trekkers past the **first view point**. The reasons may be, a lack of an established trail, heavy water scarcity, the adjacent glaciers, and a lot of wild animals.

It was pitiful to witness the heavy damage inflicted on the glaciers. Pollution resulting from our unscrupulous ways of life has resulted in their receding. A glacier that recedes leaves behind a [morraine zone][morraine] and massive [crevasses][crevasse], making it deadly to negotiate them. A small stream flowed out from the Onglakthang glacier, it was the same river which we found on Khokchurang. Needless to say melting glaciers most importantly affect our fresh water supply, which is why ensuring their protection is imperative.

A treacherous descent from the first view point led us into the sandy expanse of *Chemathang* (Chema: sand, thang: plain). This is the flat, sandy floor of a dried up old lake at *15,250 ft*. beneath the great west wall of Pandim. We trekked across Chemathang and landed into another valley. At this altitude there is almost no vegetation except juniper shrubs, poor acclimatization can be fatal here. The lack of a trail didn't deter our expert Sherpa cook *Marie*, and he went off on his own to recce a campsite; we soon lost him in the vast wilderness of the valley. Besides a fine cook, Marie is an excellent navigator, a partner to our incredible forays into the Himalayas. The place was abound with multiple footprints and excreta of leopards and other wild animals; as the daylight faded I grew more tense with every passing minute. We were hopelessly lost in the valley but tried to locate a water source, which was easier said than done. Behind us lay two massive morraine zone of glaciers, we were surrounded by Mt. Tin-Chen-Khang on the right and a rocky ridge leading to the Goecha peak on the left. After searching for more than half an hour we managed to locate the only water source, and approached it to find Marie setting up the kitchen tent!

By nightfall we had set up camp in Zemathang followed by a meeting to discuss plans for the final leg of the trek. The cold and difficult terrain had taken its toll, and few of our team members were suffering from high altitude sickness. The day's ordeal was intimidating and I remained silent, unsure whether I could cope up with the challenges ahead. After the brief meeting the team unanimously agreed to set up a base camp at Zemathang and let the fittest 3 among us to continue. Zemathang as we observed houses leopards and other wildlife, so we ensured certain safety practices at night.
