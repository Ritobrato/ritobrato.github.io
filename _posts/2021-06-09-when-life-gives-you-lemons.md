**When life gives you lemons, make lemonade** is the proverb of the year since 2020. No, I don't wish to prove that wrong. That is quite right actually, do make lemonades. In fact, I love lemonades ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

We have tried to cope up with these troubled times in myriad ways. I spent some pretty exciting days and others very anxious. This post is about the **highs and lows** I've experienced when the pandemic hit and India went into a national emergency mode. I intend to share with you a story that kept me going. Do let me know your ***Never Give Up*** stories in the comment section or DM me!

#### The Lockdown!

I was in the microbiology lab with a friend plating the culture media. When a professor informed us that the college would be shut down, effective from the following day. We were sent packing; I was thrilled to have received unexpected holidays with no college reopening date! ***The nationwide lockdown*** came into force from *24th March* and literally for some of us ***India stopped moving***. For the less fortunate ones, it was the beginning of the many grueling hours.

#### My tango with coding

I had ample time to fool around because online classes were not trending immediately. I chose to dive into coding with the notion that it may come in handy in bioinformatics courses. I googled what to learn, how to learn and found that [Python][anaconda] is a showstopper. The internet is replete with information and I made good headway, of course filtering out the useless. Python is indeed very cool; the codes are shorter and snappier than older languages. The `PEP8` rules enforce sleek formatting of codes. I was having a great time for a while.  Soon it struck me, I was writing or rather learning how to write pure programs with limited immediate use.

Once I had a good grip on the basics and could solve many problems, I decided to put my skills to some use. The idea of blogging was at the back of my mind for some time and today one can build a custom personal blog easily with all the tools from **Google**, **WordPress**, **Wix** etc. However, I wanted to challenge myself - ***What if I can build my personal blog myself from scratch?*** Now I was in a different ball game altogether, one needs to understand and enforce multiple languages to be able to do that! Once again **Google baba** came to my rescue, it was mind-boggling to handle thousands of materials and videos on the internet. Eventually, I came across [MDN Web docs][mdn] and [W3 Schools][w3school], and there began my journey of learning web development.

While the end of the final term of my [college][rkmv] knocked at the door, all the interviews for my post-graduation were delayed. This made me quite anxious; never achieving my dreams was a constant threat I had to battle. Nevertheless, I found solace in understanding the languages for web development one at a time. **HTML** is relatively easy to understand and enforce, a cakewalk for most. Once structuring a webpage was clear, I moved on to styling it i.e., learning **CSS**. Understanding basic CSS is also fairly straight forward but enforcing complex styles gets more tricky! Post that a webpage needs functionality, which is handled by **JavaScript**. Now my programming concepts were put to a rigorous test.

#### When the going gets tough ...

While I was figuring out JavaScript, the dates of online interviews were announced by [NBRC][nbrc] and [IISER TVM][iisertvm]. This somewhat reduced my trepidation, and I focused more on preparing for the interviews. I was once again busy but not with coding this time ðŸ˜…

The first round of interview at NBRC came and went by; it was fine and better than expected. Subsequently, the first interview for IISER TVM arrived, and it didn't go as expected. The 2nd round was horrible (so I assumed); I fumbled a lot. I was sure that I stood no chance at all, and this didn't make me sad, rather it made me angry and irritable. The interview for 2nd round at NBRC was delayed, and this further intensified my irritation.

I somehow focused more on coding and eventually built my first static website (can't show you, I pulled it off the web a while back). I moved on to learn building a dynamic website with a server end. One fine morning while I was busy cleaning my room, I got a call from a friend who already made it to IIT Bombay. I didn't want to answer it to avoid the obvious questions, I let it ring. By the time I finished cleaning, the phone had rung up for the fourth time, and I stood still - ***What the hell is wrong with him!!***

I picked up the call and heard his "**Hello... hello... hello**" on the other end.

**Dev:** Did you check the list yet? Its yours, right?

**me:** What are you saying? What's wrong?

**Dev:** Check the list; IISER published it, it mentions your roll no. If I'm not wrong.

**me:** But I checked yesterday, they didn't publish yet.

**Dev:** They published it last night, I thought you saw it already!

I threw open my old laptop in a flick, switched it on, opened the website and found the list. There it was on the screen, my roll no.: ***....00222***. Mom came in and rebuked me for not cleaning the room well enough, but it was music to my ears!
