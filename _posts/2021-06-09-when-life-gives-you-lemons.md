**When life gives you lemons, make lemonade** is the proverb of the year since 2020. No, I don't wish to prove that wrong, that is in fact quite right, do make lemonades. In fact I love lemonades ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Having said that, we have tried to cope up with these troubled times in myriad ways. I spent some pretty exciting days and others very anxious. This post is all about the **highs and lows** I've experienced so far during this pandemic. My intention is to share with you a bunch of events that kept me going. Do let me know your ***Never Give Up*** stories in the comment section or DM me!

I was in the microbiology lab with a friend plating the media, when a professor came in and informed that the college would be shut down effective from the following day. We were sent packing, I was thrilled to have received unexpected holidays with no college reopening date! ***The nationwide lockdown*** came into force from *15th March* and literally for some of us ***India stopped moving***. For the less fortunate ones, it was the beginning of the many grueling hours.

I had ample time to fool around because online classes were not trending immediately. I chose to dive into coding with a notion that it may come handy in bioinformatics courses. I googled what to learn, how to learn and found that `Python` is a showstopper. The internet is replete with information and I have made good headway, of course I had to filter out the useless.
